# 📱 GSMArena-Mobile-Brands

Welcome to **GSMArena-Mobile-Brands**! This project demonstrates scraping mobile brand data from GSMArena with a C# WinForms desktop application. We progressively built this by first scraping brands in console mode, then designing a WinForms UI with a DataGridView to show brand IDs, names, URLs, phone counts, and a Select-All checkbox column.
